        <h3 class="intro">
            Coffee roasting is a crucial step in the process of transforming coffee beans into the aromatic and flavorful beverage we all know and love. Roasting refers to the process of heating green coffee beans to various temperatures, causing them to change in color, aroma, and taste. Different roasting levels produce unique characteristics, from light and fruity to dark and bold. In this article, we'll explore the different kinds of coffee roasts and what makes each one unique.

                <h2 class="slide-title">Light Roast: Delicate Flavors and Aromas</h2>
                <p class="slide-text">Light roast coffee beans are roasted for a shorter period, typically to a temperature between 356°F and 401°F, and have a light brown color. This roast level allows the beans' natural flavors and acidity to shine through, creating a bright and tangy cup of coffee. Light roasts are often described as having a tea-like quality, with fruity, floral, or citrusy notes. They also tend to have a higher caffeine content than darker roasts.</p>
                <p class="slide-text">
                    Light roast coffee is roasted for a shorter amount of time and at a lower temperature than darker roasts. This results in a lighter color, less oily beans, and a delicate flavor and aroma with subtle fruity and floral notes. Light roast coffee is ideal for those who prefer a milder taste with less bitterness and acidity.

                <h2 class="slide-title">Medium Roast: Balanced and Versatile</h2>
                <p class="slide-text">Medium roast coffee beans are roasted to a slightly higher temperature, between 410°F and 428°F, and have a medium brown color. This roast level strikes a balance between the natural flavor of the beans and the roasting process, creating a cup of coffee that is well-rounded and balanced. Medium roasts are often described as having a nutty, chocolaty, or caramel-like flavor, with a moderate acidity and body.
       </p>
                <p class="slide-text">
                    Medium roast coffee is a balance between the light and dark roasts. The beans are roasted until they reach a medium brown color and have a medium level of acidity. This type of roast brings out the best of both worlds, offering a balanced and versatile coffee with a slightly richer taste and aroma than a light roast.

                <h2 class="slide-title">Dark Roast: Bold and Rich Tastes</h2>
                <p class="slide-text">Dark roast coffee beans are roasted to a higher temperature, typically between 437°F and 446°F, and have a dark brown or almost black color. This roast level produces a bold and robust cup of coffee, with a smoky or charred flavor profile. Dark roasts have a lower acidity and a heavier body than lighter roasts and are often associated with espresso drinks and strong, bold flavors.</p>
                <p class="slide-text">
                    Dark roast coffee is roasted for a longer time and at a higher temperature, resulting in a dark brown color and an oily surface on the beans. This roast has a bold, rich taste with a smoky, chocolaty flavor and less acidity than lighter roasts. Dark roast coffee is ideal for those who prefer a stronger taste with a more pronounced bitterness.

            <h2 class="slide-title">French Roast: Smoky and Intense Flavor Profile</h2>
                    <p class="slide-text"> French roast coffee beans are roasted to the highest temperature, above 464°F, and have a very dark brown or almost black color. This roast level produces a cup of coffee that is rich, intense, and heavy-bodied, with a pronounced smoky or burnt flavor. French roast coffee is often used for espresso drinks, as it can cut through the sweetness of milk and sugar, and is typically not recommended for those who prefer a milder coffee flavor.</p>
                <p class="slide-text">
                    French roast coffee is a type of dark roast that is roasted until the beans are almost black and have a shiny surface. This roast has a smoky, intense flavor with a slightly sweet aftertaste and is commonly used in espresso blends. French roast coffee is ideal for those who enjoy a bold and complex flavor profile.                </p>
